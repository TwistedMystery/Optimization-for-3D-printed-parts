# Optimization-for-3D-printed-parts
A Consecutive Analysis on Strength of 3D Printed Parts based on the infill percentage, Infill Shape, Wall thickness, and other factors and optimization for these parts. 
# Tensile and Compressive Testing Procedures

This project focuses on conducting tensile and compressive tests to evaluate the mechanical properties of 3D-printed specimens. The objective is to gain insight into potential issues and variations in material performance based on different configurations of infill patterns, densities, orientations, and specimen size.

## Overview

The project is divided into two primary test setups:

1. **Tensile Testing**: Investigating how different printing configurations affect tensile strength and failure modes.
2. **Compressive Testing**: Examining the impact of various factors on compressive strength and deformation.

## 1. Tensile Testing

In the tensile test, subsize specimens are printed and prepared under various configurations to examine how different infill patterns, densities, and orientations affect the mechanical properties of the printed material.

### Objective:
The goal is to compare the mechanical performance of the specimens based on:
- **Orientation**: Laid flat vs. standing.
- **Number of Walls**: Varying the number of walls of the specimen.
- **Infill Density**: Comparison between 10% and 20%.
- **Infill Shape**: Hexagonal vs. Grid.

### Factors to Study:
- **Tensile strength** variation between flat and standing specimens.
- **Impact of infill density** (20% vs. 10%) on overall tensile behavior.
- **Effects of different infill shapes** (Hexagonal vs. Grid) on specimen rigidity and failure mode.

## 2. Compressive Testing

For compressive testing, two different cube sizes are prepared: **10 x 10 x 10 mm** and **30 x 30 x 30 mm**. Similar to the tensile test, variations in the number of walls, infill density, infill shape, and print type are used to understand the impact of these parameters under compression.

### Objective:
The setup is designed to observe how cube size, infill density, infill shape, and print orientation influence compressive strength.

### Factors to Study:
- **Infill shape** (Hexagonal vs. Grid) and its relation to compressive failure patterns.
- **Effect of specimen size** on compressive strength.
- **Comparison of standing and laid-flat orientations** under compression to analyze stability.
