# Optimization-for-3D-printed-parts
A Consecutive Analysis on Strength of 3D Printed Parts based on the infill percentage, Infill Shape, Wall thickness, and other factors and optimization for these parts. 
# Tensile and Compressive Testing Procedures
This project focuses on conducting tensile and compressive tests to evaluate the mechanical properties of 3D-printed specimens. The objective is to gain insight into potential issues and variations in material performance based on different configurations of infill patterns, densities, orientations, and specimen size.

## Overview

The project is divided into two test setups:

1. **Tensile Testing**: Investigating how different printing configurations affect tensile strength and failure modes.
2. **Compressive Testing**: Examining the impact of various factors on compressive strength and deformation.

In the tensile test, subsize specimens are printed and prepared under various configurations to examine how different infill patterns, densities, and orientations affect the mechanical properties of the printed material.

## 2. Compressive Testing

For compressive testing, two different cube sizes are prepared: **10 x 10 x 10 mm** and **30 x 30 x 30 mm**. Similar to the tensile test, variations in the number of walls, infill density, infill shape, and print type are used to understand the impact of these parameters under compression.
