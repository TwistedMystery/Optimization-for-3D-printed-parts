## 1. Tensile Testing

In the tensile test, subsize specimens are printed and prepared under various configurations to examine how different infill patterns, densities, and orientations affect the mechanical properties of the printed material.

### Objective:
The goal is to compare the mechanical performance of the specimens based on:
- **Wall Line Count**: Varying the number of walls of the specimen.
- **Infill Density**: Variying percentage of Infill density.
- **Infill Shape**: All 14 different infill shapes.

## 2. Compressive Testing

</div>

For compressive testing, two different cube sizes are prepared: **10 x 10 x 10 mm** and **30 x 30 x 30 mm**. Similar to the tensile test, variations in the number of walls, infill density, infill shape, and print type are used to understand the impact of these parameters under compression.

### Objective:
The goal is to compare the mechanical performance of the specimens based on:
- **Wall Line Count**: Varying the number of walls of the specimen.
- **Infill Density**: Variying percentage of Infill density.
- **Infill Shape**: All 14 different infill shapes.

This README serves as a preparation guide and provides an overview of the setup for tensile and compressive testing. Results from these tests will help in identifying the optimal printing configurations for improved mechanical performance.
