## Introduction of Statistical Tools (JASP and ANOVA)
To further enhance the analysis of the data collected, we will use **JASP**, a free and open-source statistical software, to perform an **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**. This method will help:
- **Identify significant factors** affecting the strength and performance of 3D-printed parts.
- Compare variations in strength based on parameters such as infill density, wall line count, and infill shape.

### New Plan Dated 05-04-2025
To gain critical information and get valid results, the approach to the optimization of 3D print parameters will be
- Design of Experiments to reduce the wastage of marterial that is being tested via incorporating 4 different parameters with 4 variations each the table for the design of experiments is given below.
- Testing the 16 Experiments and retesting based on test data.
- Parento Analysis to determine how different factors/parameters affect the ultimate tensile strength.
- Utilizing RSM to optimize the parameters and final testing to validate the results.

This addition will provide a robust statistical foundation to validate experimental findings and refine optimization techniques.

## üìä Statistical Analysis & Optimization

To enhance the reliability of our data and streamline optimization, we have integrated **Pareto Analysis** and **Response Surface Methodology (RSM)** into the experimental workflow.

### üß© Pareto Analysis ‚Äì Identifying Critical Parameters

**Objective:**  
To prioritize which parameters most significantly impact the strength and performance of 3D-printed parts.

**üîß How It's Done:**

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Aggregate strength values (e.g., tensile strength) from all 16 DOE test runs.
   - Structure the dataset by parameter variations: Infill Density, Wall Line Count, Infill Shape, and Layer Height.

2. **Effect Size Calculation**  
   - Determine each parameter‚Äôs contribution to the output response (e.g., UTS - Ultimate Tensile Strength).
   - Use software (Excel, JASP, etc.) to calculate contribution percentages.

3. **Build Pareto Chart üìâ**  
   - Plot parameter impact in descending order.
   - Identify the ‚Äúvital few‚Äù that contribute to ~80% of the outcome variation.
   - This helps focus on optimizing the most influential parameters.

> üéØ **Outcome:** A prioritized list of parameters for optimization, saving time and resources in subsequent experiments.

### üî¨ Response Surface Methodology (RSM) ‚Äì Fine-Tuning for Optimization

**Objective:**  
To model the relationship between key parameters and tensile strength,

This README serves as a comprehensive guide and provides an overview of the setup, statistical analysis, and optimization techniques for tensile and compressive testing. Results from these analyses will guide the selection of optimal printing configurations for enhanced mechanical performance.

RSM allows us to:
- Explore **nonlinear relationships** between parameters and outcomes.
- **Visualize** parameter interactions using 3D plots.
- Predict **optimal combinations** for maximum performance.

---

**üõ†Ô∏è Steps for Implementing RSM:**

1. **Select Significant Parameters**  
   - Based on Pareto Analysis, choose the top 2‚Äì3 parameters that affect strength the most.
   - Define their practical ranges (e.g., Infill Density: 10% to 70%).

2. **Design the Experiment Grid**  
   - Use **Central Composite Design (CCD)** or **Box-Behnken Design** to structure new test runs.
   - These designs reduce the number of required tests while capturing interaction effects.

3. **Build the Response Model üìä**  
   - Fit a second-order polynomial regression model:
   - **Equation:**

Y = Œ≤‚ÇÄ + Œ≤‚ÇÅX‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇX‚ÇÇ + Œ≤‚ÇÉX‚ÇÉ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅX‚ÇÅ¬≤ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇX‚ÇÇ¬≤ + Œ≤‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉX‚ÇÉ¬≤ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇX‚ÇÅX‚ÇÇ + Œ≤‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉX‚ÇÅX‚ÇÉ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ‚ÇÉX‚ÇÇX‚ÇÉ

**What it means:**

- **Y** = Output response (e.g., tensile strength)
- **X‚ÇÅ, X‚ÇÇ, X‚ÇÉ** = Input parameters (e.g., Infill Density, Wall Line Count, Layer Height)
- **Œ≤‚ÇÄ** = Constant term (intercept)
- **Œ≤‚ÇÅ, Œ≤‚ÇÇ, Œ≤‚ÇÉ** = Linear coefficients
- **Œ≤‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ, Œ≤‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ, Œ≤‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ** = Quadratic coefficients
- **Œ≤‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ, Œ≤‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ, Œ≤‚ÇÇ‚ÇÉ** = Interaction coefficients between parameters

üìå This equation helps model the system behavior and predict the optimal configuration for maximum strength and minimal material waste.
4. **Generate Plots & Analyze**  
   - Create **3D surface plots** and **contour plots** to observe how the response varies.
   - Identify ridges, peaks, and valleys in the surface‚Äîthese represent optimal or suboptimal zones.

5. **Optimize & Validate üöÄ**  
   - Use the model to predict **optimal printing settings**.
   - Print and test new specimens using the predicted configuration.
   - Validate whether the optimized print shows improved mechanical performance.

> üß™ **Result:** A statistically validated configuration that boosts print strength while minimizing material waste and experimental trials.
