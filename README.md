## Tensile and Compressive Testing Procedures
This project focuses on conducting **tensile** and **compressive tests** to evaluate the mechanical properties of 3D-printed specimens. The goal is to gain insight into potential issues and material performance variations based on different configurations of **infill patterns**, **densities**, **orientations**, and **specimen size**.

---

## Overview
The project aims to analyze the effects of **3D printing parameters** on the mechanical properties of 3D-printed parts using two test setups:
- **Tensile Testing**
- **Compressive Testing**

## Introduction of Statistical Tools (JASP and ANOVA)
To further enhance the analysis of the data collected, we will use **JASP**, a free and open-source statistical software, to perform an **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**. This method will help:
- **Identify significant factors** affecting the strength and performance of 3D-printed parts.
- Compare variations in strength based on parameters such as infill density, wall line count, and infill shape.

### New Plan Dated 05-04-2025
To gain critical information and get valid results, the approach to the optimization of 3D print parameters will be
- Design of Experiments to reduce the wastage of marterial that is being tested via incorporating 4 different parameters with 4 variations each the table for the design of experiments is given below.
- Testing the 16 Experiments and retesting based on test data.
- Parento Analysis to determine how different factors/parameters affect the ultimate tensile strength.
- Utilizing RSM to optimize the parameters and final testing to validate the results.

This addition will provide a robust statistical foundation to validate experimental findings and refine optimization techniques.

## ðŸ“Š Experimental Setup & Parameters

We aim to evaluate how different print parameters affect mold quality and casting ease. Parameters such as infill density, wall line count, infill shape, and layer height are varied systematically.
